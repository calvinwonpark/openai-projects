# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Startups

## Growth Metrics

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- **Definition**: Predictable revenue generated every month from subscriptions
- **Calculation**: Sum of all monthly subscription fees
- **Why it matters**: Primary metric for SaaS businesses, shows growth trajectory
- **Target**: 10-20% MoM growth for early stage

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- **Definition**: MRR × 12
- **Why it matters**: Standard metric for valuing SaaS companies
- **Target**: $1M ARR is a key milestone (Series A readiness)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- **Definition**: Total sales and marketing spend / Number of new customers
- **Why it matters**: Efficiency of customer acquisition
- **Target**: CAC payback period < 12 months, ideally < 6 months

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
- **Definition**: Average revenue per customer × Average customer lifespan
- **Calculation**: (Average monthly revenue per customer × Gross margin %) / Churn rate
- **Why it matters**: Long-term value of each customer
- **Target**: LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1 (ideally 5:1 or higher)

### Churn Rate
- **Definition**: Percentage of customers who cancel in a given period
- **Calculation**: (Customers lost in period / Customers at start) × 100
- **Why it matters**: Retention is critical for sustainable growth
- **Target**: < 5% monthly churn for SaaS, < 10% for early stage

## Efficiency Metrics

### Burn Rate
- **Definition**: Monthly cash outflow (expenses - revenue)
- **Why it matters**: How long until you run out of money
- **Calculation**: Total expenses - Total revenue (monthly)
- **Target**: Extend runway, reduce burn as you scale

### Runway
- **Definition**: How many months until you run out of cash
- **Calculation**: Cash balance / Monthly burn rate
- **Why it matters**: Critical for fundraising timing
- **Target**: Raise when you have 6-9 months runway remaining

### Gross Margin
- **Definition**: (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100
- **Why it matters**: Profitability potential
- **Target**: > 70% for SaaS, > 50% for marketplaces

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- **Definition**: Revenue from existing customers (including upsells) / Starting revenue
- **Why it matters**: Growth from existing customers (expansion revenue)
- **Target**: > 100% (means you're growing from existing customers)

## Product Metrics

### Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
- **Definition**: Users who engage with product daily/monthly
- **Why it matters**: Engagement and product-market fit
- **Target**: DAU/MAU ratio > 20% for consumer, > 40% for B2B

### Activation Rate
- **Definition**: % of users who complete key onboarding action
- **Why it matters**: First impression and product value delivery
- **Target**: > 40% activation rate

### Time to Value
- **Definition**: Time from signup to first "aha moment"
- **Why it matters**: Faster time to value = better retention
- **Target**: Minimize - aim for same-day or same-week

## Sales Metrics

### Sales Cycle Length
- **Definition**: Average time from first contact to closed deal
- **Why it matters**: Predictability and cash flow
- **Target**: Shorter is better, varies by deal size

### Win Rate
- **Definition**: Closed deals / Total opportunities × 100
- **Why it matters**: Sales efficiency
- **Target**: > 20% for outbound, > 40% for inbound

### Average Contract Value (ACV)
- **Definition**: Total contract value / Number of customers
- **Why it matters**: Revenue per customer
- **Target**: Higher ACV = more efficient sales

## Investor Benchmarks

### Series A Readiness
- $1M+ ARR (or clear path)
- 10-20% MoM growth
- LTV:CAC > 3:1
- < 5% monthly churn
- Product-market fit signals

### Series B Readiness
- $5-10M+ ARR
- Consistent growth (even if slower)
- Unit economics working
- Clear path to profitability
- Market leadership position

## Tracking Best Practices

1. **Dashboard everything** - Real-time visibility into key metrics
2. **Weekly reviews** - Track trends, not just absolute numbers
3. **Cohort analysis** - Compare performance across customer cohorts
4. **Leading indicators** - Track metrics that predict future performance
5. **Context matters** - Compare to industry benchmarks and your own history
