## Design Principles

**Keep it Visual**
- Use charts, graphs, images
- Minimal text (6 words per bullet max)
- High-quality visuals
- Consistent design language

**Tell a Story**
- Problem → Solution → Market → Traction → Team → Ask
- Create emotional connection
- Show vision and ambition

**Be Specific**
- Use real numbers, not "millions of users"
- Concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- Actual customer quotes, not hypotheticals

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too much text** - Slides are visual aids, not documents
2. **Unclear value prop** - Can't explain what you do in one sentence
3. **Weak problem statement** - Problem isn't urgent or painful enough
4. **Unrealistic projections** - Numbers don't match traction
5. **Missing team slide** - Investors invest in teams
6. **No clear ask** - Unclear how much you need and why

## Investor Presentation Tips

- **Practice, practice, practice** - Know your deck cold
- **Time management** - 10-15 minutes for deck, rest for Q&A
- **Be ready for questions** - Prepare answers to common objections
- **Show passion** - Investors invest in founders, not just ideas
- **Have a demo ready** - Live demo is powerful if product exists
