# Founder Copilot (Responses API)

An AI-powered assistant for startup founders, migrated from OpenAI's Assistants API to the Responses API. This project maintains all the functionality of the original founder-copilot but uses the new Responses API instead of the deprecated Assistants API.

## Migration Status

This project is a migration from the Assistants API to the Responses API. Key changes:

- **Assistants → System Prompts**: Instead of creating assistant objects, we use system prompts with Chat Completions
- **Threads → Conversation History**: Instead of thread management, we maintain conversation history in memory/database
- **file_search tool → Vector Search**: Instead of using the file_search tool, we perform vector search ourselves and inject context
- **code_interpreter tool → Function Calling**: Instead of code_interpreter, we use function calling with Python execution

## Features

- 🤖 **AI Assistant** - Powered by GPT-4 with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- 🎯 **Multi-Assistant Routing** - Intelligent routing to specialized assistants (Tech, Marketing, Investor)
- 📚 **Knowledge Base** - Vector store containing startup resources (YC advice, checklists, scenarios)

- 🔍 **File Search** - Automatic retrieval of relevant information from knowledge base
- 📝 **Source Citations** - Automatic extraction and display of source files with quotes
- 🧮 **Code Interpreter** - Python code execution for founder analytics, calculations, and visualizations
- 📈 **Chart Display** - Automatic extraction and display of charts/visualizations generated by code execution
- 📎 **File Upload** - Upload CSV, Excel, or other files for analysis and visualization
- 📋 **Product Card System** - Automatic extraction and management of product context for deictic references
- 🔄 **File Persistence** - Automatic re-attachment of files across follow-up questions in data analysis flows
- 📊 **Metrics Dashboard** - Track token usage, latency (P95), and request statistics
- 🚦 **Rate Limiting** - Redis-based rate limiting to protect API endpoints
- 🐳 **Docker Support** - Easy deployment with Docker Compose

## Setup
