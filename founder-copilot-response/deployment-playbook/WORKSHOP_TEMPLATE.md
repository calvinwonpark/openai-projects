# 60-Minute Deployment Discovery Workshop

## Goal
Align business, technical, and risk stakeholders on one high-confidence pilot for workflow automation using routed AI advisors and tool calling.

## Agenda
- **0-10 min: Outcomes + Constraints**
  - What business KPI should improve in 8-12 weeks?
  - What constraints are fixed (budget, compliance, staffing)?
- **10-25 min: Current Workflow Mapping**
  - Which founder/ops workflows are repetitive and document-heavy?
  - Where do routing + domain advisors (tech/marketing/investor) add leverage?
- **25-40 min: Tooling + Data Readiness**
  - What sources power `file_search` (docs, playbooks, decks)?
  - Which tasks need `code_interpreter` (analysis, scenario modeling)?
  - What tenant boundaries and access controls are required?
- **40-50 min: Safety + Reliability**
  - What should be refused/escalated?
  - What failure fallback is acceptable (single-advisor fallback, human review)?
- **50-60 min: Pilot Definition**
  - Select 1 pilot use case, owner, target users, and success metrics.
  - Confirm baseline, target, and go/no-go checkpoint date.

## Output Checklist
- Pilot use case statement
- Scoped user group + tenant model
- Required tools/data inventory
- Risks + mitigations
- Success metric targets
