# OpenAI Projects

A collection of production-grade projects showcasing various OpenAI API capabilities and patterns.

## Projects

### Founder Copilot (Assistants API)
Built a production-grade multi-assistant system with vector retrieval, tool calling (code_interpreter), streaming SSE, analytics dashboard, and Docker deployment. Features intelligent routing to specialized assistants (Tech, Marketing, Investor), product card management, file persistence, and comprehensive metrics tracking.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Assistants API, Vector Stores API, Threads API, File Search tool, Code Interpreter tool

### Founder Copilot – Responses API Migration
Migrated the full system to the new Responses API using function calling and custom vector search. Maintains all original functionality (multi-assistant routing, streaming, analytics) while using the modern Responses API architecture with conversation-based state management. Features robust file and image extraction from Responses API outputs, including direct HTTP retrieval of container files generated by code_interpreter.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Responses API, Chat Completions API, Embeddings API (for custom vector search), Function Calling, Containers API (for file retrieval)

### K-Food Helpdesk (RAG)
Enterprise-style safe RAG pilot template for an AI deployment interview setting. Uses pgvector + FastAPI + Next.js with strict JSON outputs, verifiable citations, prompt-injection-resistant context handling, PII redaction hooks, per-request traceability, and offline eval + CI gating.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Embeddings API (`text-embedding-3-small`), Chat Completions API (configurable via `MODEL_NAME`, default `gpt-4o-mini`)

### GIR Caddie (Multimodal)
Created a GPT-4o Vision golf strategy assistant that parses course images, detects hazards, and generates LLM-based shot plans. Analyzes scorecards, hole layouts, and player profiles to maximize Green In Regulation (GIR) probability with strategic club recommendations.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Chat Completions API (GPT-4o), Vision API (GPT-4o Vision)

### Responses Chatbot
Simple chatbot implementation using the Responses API with code interpreter support for data analysis and visualization. Demonstrates basic Responses API usage patterns including file uploads, container file handling, and image extraction.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Responses API, Code Interpreter (via Responses API)

### TeachMe Live (Realtime API)
Production-grade real-time voice tutoring application with bidirectional voice conversations, multilingual support (Korean/English), and intelligent translation mode. Features AI-powered Tutor Notes generation that demonstrates multi-agent orchestration by combining Realtime API with Responses API. Includes image upload for homework questions, natural backchannels, smart speech detection, and real-time study notes with key concepts, examples, common mistakes, and review topics.

**OpenAI APIs Used:** Realtime API, Responses API (for Tutor Notes), GPT Realtime (gpt-realtime)
