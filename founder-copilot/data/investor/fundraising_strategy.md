# Fundraising Strategy for Startups

## Pre-Seed and Seed Stage

### When to Raise
- You have a working product or MVP
- Early traction or user validation
- Clear path to product-market fit
- Need capital to accelerate growth

### How Much to Raise
- **18-24 months of runway** is the standard
- Calculate: (Monthly burn rate × 18-24) + buffer for unexpected costs
- Typical seed rounds: $500K - $2M
- Typical pre-seed: $100K - $500K

### Investor Types

**Angel Investors**
- Individual investors, often former founders
- Invest $10K - $100K typically
- Faster decisions, less due diligence
- Good for early validation and connections

**Seed VCs**
- Early-stage venture capital firms
- Invest $250K - $2M typically
- More structured process, longer timeline
- Bring strategic value beyond capital

**Accelerators**
- Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.
- Provide $100K - $150K for equity
- Intensive 3-month programs
- Strong network and mentorship

## Fundraising Process

### 1. Preparation Phase (2-3 months before)
- Refine your pitch deck
- Prepare financial models and projections
- Build investor target list (50-100 names)
- Warm up your network for introductions

### 2. Outreach Phase
- Start with warm introductions (best)
- Cold outreach to investors who invest in your space
- Attend demo days, networking events
- Use platforms like AngelList, Crunchbase

### 3. Pitch Meetings
- First meeting: 30-60 minutes, focus on story
- Follow-up meetings: Deep dive on metrics, team, market
- Be prepared for tough questions
- Show traction, not just potential

### 4. Due Diligence
- Investors will check: financials, legal structure, team background
- Have documents ready: cap table, financials, contracts
- Be transparent about risks and challenges

### 5. Term Sheet Negotiation
- Get legal counsel (critical!)
- Key terms: valuation, equity %, board seats, liquidation preferences
- Don't optimize for valuation alone - consider investor value-add

## Key Metrics Investors Care About

**Pre-Seed/Seed:**
- User growth rate (MoM)
- Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU ratio)
- Product-market fit signals
- Team quality and execution

**Series A:**
- Revenue growth (MoM, YoY)
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- Burn rate and runway
- Market size and competitive position

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Raising too early** - Wait until you have traction
2. **Raising too much** - Dilutes equity unnecessarily
3. **Wrong investor fit** - Choose investors who understand your space
4. **Poor pitch deck** - Unclear value proposition or market size
5. **Ignoring legal** - Get proper legal counsel for term sheets

## Red Flags for Investors

- Unrealistic valuations
- No clear path to revenue
- Weak team or missing key roles
- Small or shrinking market
- Poor unit economics
- No competitive moat

## Tips for Success

- **Build relationships early** - Start talking to investors 6+ months before raising
- **Show momentum** - Investors invest in trends, show consistent growth
- **Be coachable** - Listen to feedback, iterate on your pitch
- **Create FOMO** - Have multiple interested parties to create urgency
- **Know your numbers** - Be able to speak to every metric in your deck
