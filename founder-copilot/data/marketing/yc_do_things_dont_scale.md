# Do Things That Don't Scale

## The Counterintuitive Path to Startup Success

Many founders believe that everything must scale from day one. But the most successful startups often start by doing things that don't scale.

### Why This Works

1. **Personal Touch Creates Loyalty**: When you manually onboard your first 100 users, you learn their needs intimately. This knowledge becomes your competitive advantage.

2. **Manual Processes Reveal Automation Opportunities**: You can't automate what you don't understand. Doing things manually first shows you what actually needs to be automated.

3. **Early Users Become Advocates**: Hand-holding early users turns them into passionate evangelists who will help you grow.

### Examples of "Don't Scale" Activities

- **Manual Onboarding**: Personally walk each user through your product
- **Hand-Crafted Outreach**: Write personalized emails to potential customers
- **Manual Data Entry**: Process initial transactions manually to understand the workflow
- **Direct Customer Support**: Answer every support ticket yourself
- **Custom Solutions**: Build one-off features for your first enterprise customer

### When to Scale

The key is knowing when to transition from manual to automated:

- When you've learned what works and what doesn't
- When manual processes become a bottleneck
- When you have enough data to build the right automation
- When you can't personally handle the volume anymore

### The Paradox

The startups that obsess over scalability from day one often fail. The ones that start manual and learn first often succeed. Scale is important, but learning is more important.

### Action Items

1. Identify one process you're trying to automate too early
2. Do it manually for your next 10 customers
3. Document what you learn
4. Then build the automation based on real experience
