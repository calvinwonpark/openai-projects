# Copywriting Tips for Startups

## Core Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- **Be direct** - Say what you mean, clearly
- **Avoid jargon** - Use simple language
- **One idea per sentence** - Don't overload readers
- **Test with real users** - If they don't get it, rewrite it

### Focus on Benefits, Not Features
- **Feature**: "AI-powered algorithm"
- **Benefit**: "Get personalized recommendations in seconds"
- **Why it matters**: Customers buy outcomes, not technology

### Write for Your Audience
- **Know your customer** - What language do they use?
- **Match their tone** - Formal vs. casual, technical vs. simple
- **Address their pain points** - What keeps them up at night?
- **Speak their language** - Use their terminology

## Headline Writing

### Formula: Benefit + Specificity + Urgency
- **Bad**: "Our Product is Great"
- **Good**: "Reduce Customer Support Tickets by 40% in 30 Days"

### Headline Types
- **How-to**: "How to [Achieve Desired Outcome]"
- **Question**: "Tired of [Pain Point]?"
- **Number**: "5 Ways to [Benefit]"
- **Contrarian**: "Why [Common Belief] is Wrong"

### Testing Headlines
- **A/B test** - Try multiple variations
- **Measure clicks** - Which headlines perform?
- **Iterate** - Keep improving based on data

## Value Proposition

### The One-Liner Test
- Can you explain what you do in one sentence?
- If not, simplify until you can
- Example: "We help B2B SaaS companies reduce churn by 30% using AI"

### Value Prop Framework
1. **What you do** - Your product/service
2. **Who it's for** - Target customer
3. **Why it matters** - Key benefit
4. **What makes you different** - Unique advantage

### Examples
- **Uber**: "Tap a button, get a ride"
- **Slack**: "Where work happens"
- **Notion**: "All-in-one workspace for notes, docs, and collaboration"

## Email Copywriting

### Subject Lines
- **Personalization** - Use recipient's name or company
- **Curiosity gap** - Make them want to open
- **Urgency** - Limited time, limited spots
- **Value** - What's in it for them?
- **Avoid spam words** - Free, guarantee, act now

### Email Body
- **Get to the point** - First sentence should hook
- **Short paragraphs** - 2-3 sentences max
- **Clear CTA** - One action, prominently placed
- **Mobile-friendly** - Most emails read on phone

### Email Types
- **Welcome emails** - Set expectations, show value
- **Newsletters** - Regular valuable content
- **Promotional** - Sales, offers, announcements
- **Transactional** - Confirmations, receipts, updates

## Landing Page Copy

### Above the Fold
- **Headline** - Main value proposition
- **Subheadline** - Supporting detail
- **CTA button** - Clear action
- **Visual** - Product screenshot or hero image

### Body Copy
- **Problem** - What pain point do you solve?
- **Solution** - How you solve it
- **Proof** - Testimonials, logos, numbers
- **Benefits** - What they get
- **CTA** - Multiple CTAs throughout page

### Trust Signals
- **Social proof** - "Join 10,000+ companies"
- **Testimonials** - Real customer quotes
- **Logos** - Well-known customers
- **Guarantees** - Money-back, free trial
- **Security badges** - SSL, compliance

## Social Media Copy

### Platform-Specific
- **Twitter** - Short, punchy, hashtags
- **LinkedIn** - Professional, longer form
- **Instagram** - Visual-first, captions support image
- **TikTok** - Hook in first 3 seconds

### Engagement Tactics
- **Ask questions** - Encourage comments
- **Tell stories** - Personal, relatable
- **Use humor** - When appropriate
- **Share behind-the-scenes** - Humanize brand
- **User-generated content** - Repost customers

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Best Practices

### CTA Text
- **Action verbs** - Start, Get, Try, Join
- **Specific** - "Start Free Trial" not "Click Here"
- **Benefit-focused** - "Get Your Free Report"
- **Urgency** - "Claim Your Spot" (limited availability)

### CTA Placement
- **Above the fold** - First thing they see
- **Multiple times** - Throughout page/email
- **End of content** - After you've made your case
- **Sticky** - Fixed position as they scroll

### CTA Design
- **Contrasting color** - Stands out from page
- **Large enough** - Easy to click/tap
- **Whitespace** - Not crowded by other elements
- **Mobile-friendly** - Thumb-friendly size

## Common Copywriting Mistakes

1. **Too much text** - Brevity is clarity
2. **Features over benefits** - Sell outcomes, not tech
3. **Weak CTAs** - "Learn More" is weak, be specific
4. **No proof** - Claims without evidence
5. **Wrong tone** - Too formal or too casual for audience
6. **Jargon overload** - Confusing instead of clarifying
7. **No testing** - Not A/B testing copy variations

## Writing Process

1. **Research** - Understand audience, competitors, market
2. **Outline** - Structure before writing
3. **Write first draft** - Don't edit while writing
4. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut 50% of words
5. **Test** - A/B test different versions
6. **Iterate** - Improve based on data
